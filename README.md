## 🔥 How to Use This Guide

### If You're a Student

* Read **Section 1 → 6** in order
* Practice the example code in a browser console / Node.js

### If You're Preparing for Interviews

* Focus on **Section 3, 5, and 6** — these are the most commonly asked topics
* Try explaining each concept to yourself out loud

### If You're a Trainer / Instructor

* You can use these notes as slides, whiteboard explanations, or workshop content

## 🧠 Recommended Learning Order

1. Scope → Execution Context
2. Hoisting → TDZ
3. Closures → Lexical Environment
4. Objects → Prototypes → Classes
5. `this` → call/apply/bind → Arrow Functions
6. Event Loop → Promises → async/await

Master these ➝ you understand JavaScript deeply.

## ✅ Example Concept Flow (Quick Visual)

```
Global Execution Context
↓
Function Execution Context
↓
Lexical Environment
↓
Closure
↓
Prototype Chain
↓
Event Loop + Async Flow
```

Understanding this chain is key to writing correct, predictable JS.

---

## 🧩 Requirements

* Node.js (optional for running examples)
* Any text editor (VS Code recommended)

---

## ⭐ Recommendation

Use this guide together with:

* Chrome DevTools
* `console.log()` experimentation

Learning becomes **much easier** when visualized.
