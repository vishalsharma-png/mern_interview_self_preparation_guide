## üß† Recommended Learning Order

1. Scope ‚Üí Execution Context
2. Hoisting ‚Üí TDZ
3. Closures ‚Üí Lexical Environment
4. Objects ‚Üí Prototypes ‚Üí Classes
5. `this` ‚Üí call/apply/bind ‚Üí Arrow Functions
6. Event Loop ‚Üí Promises ‚Üí async/await

Master these ‚ûù you understand JavaScript deeply.

Event Loop + Async Flow
```

Understanding this chain is key to writing correct, predictable JS.

##  Requirements

* Node.js (optional for running examples)
* Any text editor (VS Code recommended)

---

## Recommendation

Use this guide together with:

* Chrome DevTools
* `console.log()` experimentation

Learning becomes **much easier** when visualized.
